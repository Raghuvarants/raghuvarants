I'm an assistant professor in the Linguistics Department at the University of Pennsylvania and the director of the Child Language Lab.

I teach graduate seminars in psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics and an undergraduate course in language and the brain. Occasionally, I also teach LING 1, Penn's Introduction to Linguistics.

This semester I'm teaching a new undergraduate course (with Colin Twomey): Data Science for Studying Language and the Mind.
